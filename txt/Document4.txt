The effect of Covid restrictions and the pandemic on children with Special Educational Needs could be "long-lasting" and "severe". That is according to NI's mental health champion Professor Siobhan O'Neill. Prof O'Neill also said young people as whole were "more heavily impacted by the pandemic and the restrictions than any other age group". It led to "an increase in the symptoms of mental ill health, behavioural, emotional and attention difficulties". Prof O'Neill was speaking during a briefing to assembly members on Stormont's education committee. Previous reports, including from Northern Ireland's Commissioner for Children Koulla Yiasouma, have highlighted the "severe impact" of restrictions and the pandemic on young people. There has also been a significant rise in young people in mental health crisis seeking help at hospital. Prof O'Neill told MLAs that symptoms of mental ill health in children "increased during times when there were restrictions to activities and a reduction in face-to-face teaching in schools".
