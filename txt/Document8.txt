Scientists are celebrating 212 “new” freshwater fish species, including a blind eel found in the grounds of a school for blind children and a fish named Wolverine that is armed with a hidden weapons system. The New Species 2021 report, released by the conservation organisation Shoal, shows just how diverse and remarkable the world’s often undervalued freshwater species are, and suggests there is plenty more life still to be discovered in the world’s lakes, rivers and wetlands. “It’s fascinating that over 200 new freshwater fish species can be described in just a single year,” said Harmony Patricio, Shoal’s conservation programme manager. “You might see this level of new discovery for organisms like plants or insects, but not really for vertebrates. “It means there are still hundreds and hundreds more freshwater fish out there in the world that scientists don’t know about yet,” she said. “Also, many of the newly described species have pretty unique and unexpected traits.”
