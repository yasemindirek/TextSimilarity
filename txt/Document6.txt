Formula 1 drivers have been given new driving standards guidelines before the 2022 season. The move is part of the series of changes governing body the FIA has made to try to learn the lessons from the mistakes made last year. The new guidelines outline the ways in which drivers overtaking and being overtaken must behave while fighting. The onus is on drivers to take responsibility for matters such as gaining advantage by leaving the track. This is a significant shift away from the manner in which former FIA race director Michael Masi personally intervened to tell drivers who had gone off track and gained a position to return it, and is likely to lead to more penalties. Racing ethics became a major issue throughout 2021, especially in the context of Max Verstappen's aggressive racing tactics. The new rules lay out guidelines for manoeuvres where cars are overtaking both on the inside and outside. The guidelines have not been published beyond the teams, but they have been seen by BBC Sport.
