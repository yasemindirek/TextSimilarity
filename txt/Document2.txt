The International Energy Agency urges everyone to turn down the thermostat by a degree - that could save up to 10% of heating energy (and costs), it says. Insulation is another no-brainer quick hit - and it makes your home more comfortable. Even a draught excluder "sausage" for a door makes a small difference, as does basic draught-proofing. Heating only the rooms you're using is an easy hit. A speed limit of 55mph - the most efficient running speed for many cars - could be set during the energy crisis to cut carbon emissions. That might be resisted by a libertarian PM and in any case the RAC Foundation said it would be more effective to make fewer trips, and to brake and accelerate more smoothly.Trains could reduce their top speed and services could be reduced to prevent empty running. The public might accept the restrictions if they were persuaded of an urgent need. Some analysts want the government to phase out the sale of new gas boilers and hobs rapidly. Boilers running on imported gas would be replaced by electric heat pumps powered by electricity generated by British wind farms. That would immediately cut demand but it would require a challenging increase in heat pump installations when there are too few installers and a poor supply chain. Others want a government energy savings campaign like the one employed to tackle the oil crisis in 1970s with cheeky slogans like "Save energy - bath with a friend".
